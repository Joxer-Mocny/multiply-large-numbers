# Multiply Large Numbers (Java CLI Project)

This is a simple Java command-line application that multiplies two large integers using either:

- `--alg1`: Built-in BigInteger multiplication
- `--alg2`: Manual multiplication algorithm (simulating paper-style)

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Multiplication of very large numbers (even 20+ digits)
- Two selectable algorithms via command line
- Unit tests comparing both approaches
- Clean project structure with Maven
- Ready for GitHub, Git, and further enhancements

---

## ðŸ§ª Example usage

```bash
java -jar target/multiply-large-numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --alg2 123456789 987654321
